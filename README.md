This is a personal finance management web app built using technologies such as Next.js, Redux, and Firebase.

Users can create an account and log in to access the full functionality of the app. Without logging in, users can still test some limited features. To log in, click on the logo in the top right navigation panel. Once logged in, you can start adding statements, which can later be viewed by clicking on the "View Detailed Statement" button.
